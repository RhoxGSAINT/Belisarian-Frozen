custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_brt_frozen_ordercustom_quote	The island of Albion is waiting for its once and future king, who will liberate it from the norscan occupation. Unfortunately he is nowhere to be found. Many "heroes" have tried, but none have succeeded, and many didn't even bother. You are neither the rightful heir, nor a chosen hero. You are dragon, who wants his own island to chill on, and Albion is ripe for the taking. No one from Bretonnia is going to support you of course, not even its peasants, but that is ok, you can make your army out of snow instead. So of to the Albion you go!	true
